# AoC 2022 - Python - TDD

This are my AoC solutions using (typed) Python and mostly using test-driven development.

Solutions can be easily executed using [`just` command runner](https://github.com/casey/just)
(can be installed with `cargo install just`).

Examples:
* Execute part 2 of day 3 using example.txt file as input: `just solve 2 example.txt` from day3 directory.
* Execute tests from day 4: `just test`
* Download your inputs of day 7: `just input 7` (`SESSION_COOKIE` needs to be defined on `.env`)
